            <p><strong>Olanigan Aishat</strong> the CEO and Founder of Nana's Cravings is a master chef who currently operate out of our Restaurant in San Ewang Estate.  This is our commercial kitchen.</p>
            <h3>Catering </h3>
            <p>From family style comfort food to elaborate multi-course fine dining our menus can be as complex or as simple as you want them to be.  Our chef works with each of our clients to develop a unique, completely customized menu for their events and then personally prepares all the elements of those menus from scratch.  Breads are baked the morning of events; pastas are rolled out by hand; meats are brined overnight before being slow smoked, braised, or roasted for hours; sauces and gravies are made from stocks that take hours, sometimes days to make; pickles, kimchi, and krauts are brined for weeks or months; meats and seafoods are cured in house for lunch meats and gravlax.  We believe that quality takes proper time and attention and that there is no substitute for that.
                 We put the same level of attention to detail into planning all other aspect of our client’s events as our chef puts into planning and executing the menus he develops.  Room decor, linens, napkins, floral arrangements, lighting, table top decor, the planning, timing and proper execution of the vision our clients have for their events. We can handle as much as or as little of the planning for your event as you want.</p>

                    <p>As often as our bookings allow we like to hold events that are open to the public.  These events allow us to showcase the creativity and culinary range of our chef as well as our attention to detail in planning and executing events.  They also allow for us to collaborate with other local small businesses when we hold them.  We’ve worked with a range of businesses; local bakeries and patisseries, party supply vendors, breweries, bars, and fashion boutiques.  Information about our upcoming events is on our events page and is also available on our social media.  You can also email, message or call us for more information anytime.</p>
